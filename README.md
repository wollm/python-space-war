# python-space-war

A fun, easy to play, 2-player space shooter game! 
- Player 1 uses WASD to move and the left ALT/Option key to fire
- Player 2 uses the traditional arrow keys to move along with the right ALT/Option key to fire.

Need to have Python installed on your machine to play!

STEPS TO PLAY:
1. Download the folder onto your machine
2. Navigate to the python-space-war-main file 
  --> '''cd pathname/python-space-war-main'''
3. Create a virtual environment for the project to live 
  --> On Windows: python -m venv venv
  --> On MacOS/Linux: python3 -m venv venv
5. Activate your virtual environment

  --> On MacOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
6. Install dependencies (for this game, only thing you need to install is the pygame module)
